## Python Basics

Basic Python programming exercises to solidify foundational concepts such as:
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and modules
- Lists, dictionaries, and other data structures
- File handling and more

## NumPy

Numerical Python (`NumPy`) is a powerful library for performing numerical computations. Practice includes:
- Creating arrays
- Array manipulation
- Mathematical operations on arrays
- Broadcasting and vectorization

## Pandas

The `Pandas` library is essential for data manipulation and analysis. Topics include:
- Creating and manipulating DataFrames
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Grouping, merging, and joining data
- Handling missing values

## Seaborn

`Seaborn` is a Python visualization library based on `Matplotlib`, used to create informative statistical graphics. Here you will find:
- Data visualization techniques
- Plotting histograms, scatter plots, and more
- Advanced plotting with pairplots, heatmaps, etc.

## Statistics & Probability

This section focuses on the statistical methods and probability theory used in data science, covering:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
- Probability distributions (normal, binomial, etc.)
- Hypothesis testing
- Correlation and regression analysis
